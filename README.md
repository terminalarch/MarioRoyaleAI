# Mario Royale AI
The very first Mario Royale... AI? No, it's more of an A.<br>
This new [Python](https://python.org) program rolls a dice and chooses a random input once every .8 seconds.<br>

The program logs it's decisions and prints it in the console, and you get to watch it suffer.<br>

There is absolutely zero strategy, good luck having the "AI" pass the 1-1 goomba.

## Installation
You will need a program and pip to run the software
- Install [Python](https://python.org) from the official website
- Download/clone this repository then extract it to a folder, then cd into it
- Install the **pynput** package from pip3

## Notes
The program will start 5 seconds after being started, so rush into the game before it starts screwing your desktop.<br>
Good luck. You will need it.
